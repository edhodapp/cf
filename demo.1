The CF library comes with a demonstration program called "demo".
"demo" can be invoked in several ways:

        demo n d

This uses new_rat() to construct a continued fraction representing the
rational number n/d.  The terms of the continued fraction are then
printed.

        demo real

"real" is a real number, for example 1.4238.  new_rat_from_float() is
used to build a continued fraction with this value, and its terms are
then printed.

        demo a b c d x

"x" is a real number in decimal format as above.  a..d are integers. A
continued fraction is built to represent the value of
(ax+b)/(cx+d), and its terms are printed.

        demo a b c d e f g h x y 

"x" and "y" are real numbers as above.  a..h are integers.  A
continued fraction is built to represent the value of
(axy+bx+cy+d)/(exy+fx+gy+h), and its terms are printed.

        demo x + y
        demo x - y
        demo x * y
        demo x / y

"x" and "y" are real numbers as above.  Continued fractions are built
for these two numbers, and then a third continued fraction is built
for their sum, difference, product, or quotient as indicated.  The
terms of the result are printed. 

Note that '*' is special in the shell and will need to be quoted.  The
program will accept the letter "x" as a synonym.
