This is a small library for continued fraction calculations, written
in C.  For more details about continued fractions and the algorithms
herein, see 

        http://perl.plover.com/yak/cftalk/

The library is documented in "libcf.3".

The Makefile builds a program called "cf-demo" that demonstrates the
library.  This is fully documented in "demo.1".  A brief usage summary
follows.

        cf-demo num den

Print the continued fraction expansion of rational number num/den.
For example, "cf-demo 29 8" prints "3 1 1 1 2".

	cf-demo x

Print the continued fraction expansion of floating point number x.
For example, "cf-demo 1.4142" prints "1 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 29 86 312".

	cf-demo a b c d x

Print the continued fraction expansion of (ax+b)/(cx+d) where
a,b,c,d are integers and x is real.

	cf-demo a b c d e f g h x y


Print the continued fraction expansion of (axy+bx+cy+d)/(exy+fx+gy+h)
where a..h are integers and x and y are real.

	cf-demo x + y
	cf-demo x - y
	cf-demo x * y
	cf-demo x / y

x and y are first converted to continued fractions, and then the
indicated calculation is performed; for example 'x + y' adds x and y.
Then the resulting continued fraction is printed.  For convenience,
'x' is accepted as a synonym for '*'.
